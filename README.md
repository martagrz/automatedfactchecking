# Automated Fact Checking 

This repo contains the final report and source code for a course on Information Retrieval and Data Mining. It uses the FEVER dataset with Wikipedia pages and claims that are to be verified as True, False or Not Enough Info. 

For this, I implemented a BiLSTM model with inputs for the queries and the retrieved relevant documents.
